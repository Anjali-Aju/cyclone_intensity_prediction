          <h2>Polar Cyclone</h2>
          <p>The polar cyclone is also known as the “Arctic hurricane” in the Northern Hemisphere. This is due to their energy sources. The heat is transferred from water to air and the latent heat is released in the form of cloud condensation. The forecast of the polar cyclone is difficult as they take less than 24 hours, and they are formed quickly. They are formed over the Arctic and Antarctic seas. </p>

          <h2>Mesocyclone</h2>
          <p>The mesocyclone is considered to be one of the strong thunderstorms. The mesocyclone is found within the convective storm in the form of a vortex of air. The air rises and rotates along the vertical axis. The direction of this air and the low-pressure system are the same in the given hemisphere. The mesocyclone is accompanied by the rotating air within the thunderstorm. </p>

          <h2>Extratropical Cyclone</h2>
          <p>The cyclones that are formed in the middle latitudes along the frontal boundaries are either known as extratropical cyclones or mid-latitude cyclones. The winds of the extratropical cyclone are weaker however, the temperature gradients are sharp. The nor’easter is an example of an extratropical cyclone that impacts the east coast of the United States.</p>
